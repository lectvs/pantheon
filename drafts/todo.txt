- /do we need to specify the initial texture on an animated sprite? - no
- /error messages for unsupported collider algorithms
- /pt(), rect(), etc. shortcut methods
- /volume control at the asset-level
- /change speed of sounds
- /change pitch of sounds (decided not to do for now, pitch change not supported by WebAudio so requires another library)
- /angular velocity
- /"anchor" language in asset file
- /directly set name, layer, physicsGroup on WorldObject?
- /clone bounds
- /think about constructor arguments for world objects
- /add custom debug overlay feeds
- /hoop not collide with walls
- /spritetext as a texture and not a world object? (spritetext cannot be a texture because it has moving components)
- /spritetext alignment
- /remove sound from dialog (and customize?)
- /render sprite to non-world texture?
- /investigate performance issues
    - /fps drop with dead bodies?
    - /fps drop with spritetext?
    - /optimizations
        - /static-ify generic sprites, e.g. render to some texture instead of simulating (can't do without boundless textures)
        - /do not render off-screen things
        - /optimize sprite text with static pieces
- /replace bomb state machine with script
- /not have to specify parent in physics object bounds?
- /physics object: combine vx/y/z, gravityx/y/z, etc. (decided to only do for *x/y)
- /fix guard beam color
- /init method for world objects (this is the onAdd method)
- /limit to how many runners there are
- /mage light up to indicate summoning
- /calculate hoop speed from angular speed around player
- /bring configs back!
- new content
    - add some more enemies
    - add music/ambience during silent parts
    - add dialog talking sound effects?
- investigate boss fight crash
- fix caps lock bug?
- cutscene skips
- update callback type this in bound anonymous function
- revisit dialog system
    - rewrite dialog box implementation (shouldn't use spriteText internals)
        - TODO: remove setText force parameter after
    - ???
- fix window focus issues
    - mute audio when window out of focus
    - fix sticking against the wall bug
- collect all collisions and apply callbacks/momentum transfer afterward
- define better "momentum transfer" modes (NONE, ZERO_VELOCITY, KINETIC)
- better scripting syntax?
    - look into writing TS transforms for scripts?
- camera mode transitions
- story transition delay
- better enemy behavior system
- fix bug with vx, vy = NaN
- in general clean up the storyboard
- fullscreen
- build script
- fill in README.md for others to run/build the game
