todo
- easier tilemap definition in assets?
- vector class? replace v, gravity with vectors?
- rethink tilemap zMap? z on a per-tile basis rather than per-index?
- better acceleration movement (smart clamping?)
- normalize cnoise?
- normalize angle deg/rad?
- normalize direction/vectors
- option for entities to only update within screen bounds?
