postpostjam
- error messages for unsupported collider algorithms
- fix window focus issues
- in general clean up the storyboard
- define better "momentum transfer" modes
- collect all collisions and apply callbacks/momentum transfer afterward
- add custom debug overlay feeds
- "anchor" language in asset file
- init method for world objects
- add angular velocity to sprite
- figure out why configs aren't semantically checked properly
- better scripting syntax
- camera mode transitions
- revisit dialog system
- story transition delay
- better enemy behavior system
- pt(), rect(), etc. shortcut methods
- fix bug with vx, vy = NaN
- slide inheritance
- addWorldObject type inference from `constructor` property?
- spritetext alignment
- directly set name, layer, physicsGroup on WorldObject?
- not have to specify parent in physics object bounds?
- spritetext as a texture and not a world object?
- think about constructor arguments for world objects
- physics object: combine vx/y/z, gravityx/y/z, etc.
- do we need to specify the initial texture on an animated sprite?
- angular velocity
- fps drop with spritetext?
- clone bounds
- static-ify generic sprites (e.g. render to some texture instead of simulating)
- change speed of sounds
- change pitch of sounds
- remove sound from dialog (and customize?)
- render sprite to non-world texture?
- build script
- mute audio when window out of focus
- fill in README.md for others to run/build the game
- fullscreen
