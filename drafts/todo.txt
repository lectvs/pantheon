- /do we need to specify the initial texture on an animated sprite? - no
- /error messages for unsupported collider algorithms
- /pt(), rect(), etc. shortcut methods
- /volume control at the asset-level
- /change speed of sounds
- /change pitch of sounds (decided not to do for now, pitch change not supported by WebAudio so requires another library)
- /angular velocity
- /"anchor" language in asset file
- /directly set name, layer, physicsGroup on WorldObject?
- /clone bounds
- /think about constructor arguments for world objects
- /add custom debug overlay feeds
- /hoop not collide with walls
- /spritetext as a texture and not a world object? (spritetext cannot be a texture because it has moving components)
- /spritetext alignment
- /remove sound from dialog (and customize?)
- investigate performance issues
    - /fps drop with dead bodies?
    - /fps drop with spritetext?
    - optimizations
        - static-ify generic sprites (e.g. render to some texture instead of simulating)
        - /do not render off-screen things
        - /optimize sprite text with static pieces
- new content
    - add some more enemies
    - add music/ambience during silent parts
    - add dialog talking sound effects?
- investigate boss fight crash
- limit to how many shadows there are
- fix sticking against the wall bug
- fix caps lock bug?
- cutscene skips
- rewrite dialog box implementation (shouldn't use spriteText internals)
    - TODO: remove setText force parameter after
- mage light up to indicate summoning
- fix guard beam color
- calculate hoop speed from angular speed around player
- fix window focus issues
- mute audio when window out of focus
- in general clean up the storyboard
- collect all collisions and apply callbacks/momentum transfer afterward
- define better "momentum transfer" modes
- init method for world objects
- better scripting syntax?
- camera mode transitions
- revisit dialog system
- story transition delay
- better enemy behavior system
- fix bug with vx, vy = NaN
- not have to specify parent in physics object bounds?
- physics object: combine vx/y/z, gravityx/y/z, etc.
- render sprite to non-world texture?
- fullscreen
- build script
- fill in README.md for others to run/build the game
