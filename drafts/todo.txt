todo
- easier tilemap definition in assets?
- vector class? replace v, gravity with vectors?
- rethink tilemap zMap? z on a per-tile basis rather than per-index?
- better acceleration movement (smart clamping?)
- normalize cnoise?
- normalize angle deg/rad?
- normalize direction/vectors
- option for entities to only update within screen bounds?
- limit sound effect count per effect
- random pitch/speed variation on sfx
- better global variables
- shader builder
- worldobject tag system
- variable hitboxes? (i.e. different hitboxes for wall collision vs enemy collision)
- "max distance" step functionality for collisions
