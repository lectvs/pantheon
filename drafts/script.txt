THE PAST
- psi, a young child, is a subject of human experimentation alongside others given similar greek-letter names
- things he would see and remember there
    - cages
    - greek letter designations around cages
    - blood
    - other kids-turned-monstrosities
- psi is the subject of experimentation on the eyes. he undergoes an operation that leaves him blind.
- when the researchers try to observe the results of the operation, they learn (the hard way) that his eyes now cause severe death to anyone that looks into them


THE PRESENT
- a soldier approaches a base, leading a boy behind him.
- they infiltrate the base
- make it to the storage room or whatever
- soldiers arrive and catch them out
- ???
- sai removes his blindfold, and the world warps
- flashback
- flashback cuts back to sai, who has finished his ability. everyone else in the room drops to floor, dead. sai drops to a knee, clutching his heart. the screen snaps to black, and the game ends.

SYMBOLISM
- psi and the other kids are portrayed as demons, while the researchers are portrayed as angels/pure beings. however, despite this pure appearance, the researchers are monstrous and horrifying
- throughout the PRESENT, demons appear around the base, though they are simply in sai's mind. THE GIRL appears multiple times as well, but consistently evades sai whenever they approach.
