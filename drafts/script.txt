THE PAST
- psi, a young child, is a subject of human experimentation alongside others given similar greek-letter names
- things he would see and remember there
    - cages
    - greek letter designations around cages
    - blood
    - other kids-turned-monstrosities
- psi is the subject of experimentation on the eyes. he undergoes an operation that leaves him blind.
- when the researchers try to observe the results of the operation, they learn (the hard way) that his eyes now cause severe death to anyone that looks into them


THE PRESENT
- a soldier approaches a base, leading a boy behind him.
- they infiltrate the base
- make it to the storage room or whatever
- soldiers arrive and catch them out
- ???
- papa ditches sai, leaving him to distract the guards while he plunders the base
- sai flings off his blindfold, says something witty, and opens his eyes. the world warps.
- flashback
    - ??? leads a revolt against the scientists
    - one scientist kills THE GIRL. the room breaks into riot
    - psi, in desperation, pulls off his blindfold. the world warps, and everyone - scientists and kids alike - dissolve into pixels
    - game seamlessly cuts back to the real world where sai is using that same ability
- flashback cuts back to sai, going back to when he still had his blindfold on. instead of pulling it off, however, he stands frozen. the center guard charges at him
  with a spear, impaling him. the screen snaps to black, and the game ends.

SYMBOLISM
- psi and the other kids are portrayed as demons, while the researchers are portrayed as angels/pure beings. however, despite this pure appearance, the researchers are monstrous and horrifying
- throughout the PRESENT, demons appear around the base, though they are simply in sai's mind. THE GIRL appears multiple times as well, but consistently evades sai whenever they approach.
