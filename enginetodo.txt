TODO
- theater not a world (for real this time)
    - better slides (for real this time)
- camera zoom/rotate?
- animation revamp (animation/script parity?)
    - squash/stretch/transform/etc actions
- revamp module system to work with compound types
- controller revamp
- easier global width/height
- apply filter before texture transformation during render? (rotate, scale, etc.)
- allow S scripts to be run in non-global worlds (global.script.world? how do we handle cutscenes?)
- revamp menu system, transitions from main menu to game
- custom font characters -> general textures instead?
- vs code tasks?
- fix: Options.updateCallbacks.push(() => Input.init());
- turn screen shake into a shader (to get edge continuation)
- redo kill() ... not flag the object as being dead? how to remove object then re-add it later?
- methods to take a screenshot of the canvas (full-size and 1:1 scale? copy to clipboard?)
- "humanized" option in sound asset definition
- better world and object management (freeing)
- better performance on large spritetexts
- delete useless bloat
- look into more performant graphics libraries
- attach arbitrary "update"/"render" objects to worldobjects (e.g. timers, new module system?)
- make game files group-downloadable with https://stuk.github.io/jszip/
- improve compile time
- clean up fixed framerate/nonupdate stuff
- integrate debug textures/sfx into the engine?
- yield multiple comma-separated values, yield number to wait, script revamp??
- bounce vs elastic tween confusion
- deprecate underscore.js
- texture crop method
- calculate text width/height while not all chars visible
- disable analytics on localhost?
- outline match texture's alpha by default?
- remake build script
    - add LICENSE to build, keep it from bloating src/lectvs/assets/etc
- analytic for mobile usage
- supertextures ("detective+hat")
- game initialization logic (in Main?)
- rename removeChild* to detachChild*
- documentation and API cleanup
- template for new games
- fix initial spaces not counting toward alignment?
- find true texture limit and re-enable in BasicTexture
- worldobject that centers/anchors its children (useful for UI)
- remove Draw.brush?
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13897659/extending-functionality-in-typescript
- figure out why we have lost auto-complete for class methods
- create better worldbounds/localbounds/visiblescreenbounds system
- good temporary object system
- fix everyNSeconds and oscillateNSeconds for very low framerates
- enable strictNullChecks, noImplicitOverride
- better resolution of copyFromParent and render ordering (polarity inverter bug)
- revisit temp approx/convolute44 methods in TextureFilter
- ability to define custom TextureFilter helper methods in shader
- update paint.net (+ plugins?)
- simplify pre- and post- effects (remove filters field?)
- better WorldAsWorldObject (containers?)
- world and worldobject hooks/events (onDeath, onLoad, etc.)
- spritetext tags are technically not assets
- set up audacity and fl studio to use aac
- combined Draw.circleSolid + Draw.circleOutline etc?
- map shader pnoise to [0, 1]?
- Texture.filledCircle/outlineCircle not having center anchor keeps tripping me up
- force user to provide a source in new BasicTexture
- asset dependencies?
- easier window event integration (onbeforeunload, etc.)
- figure out what is defined in the world constructor vs what is defined in onTransitioned
- well-defined visual boundaries for every object + better World.Actions.balanceWorldObjects
- why does the developer console not open when i press F12 sometimes?
- general solution to prevent sprites from jittering relative to camera movement
- move colorToVec3 and vec3ToColor to Color util
- use shaders for puff system

stretch
- normal-map/lighting
- "window" filters
- boundless textures
    - optimize tilemap editing with boundless textures
- better keyboard text input
- print errors on screen?
- report game errors through lambda API?
- loading messages
