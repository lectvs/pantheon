TODO
- remove validations from World.Selecter caches and start caching!
- tile collision for aseprite
- build box from inside out
- propagate box changes outward (use case: box resize to fit text)
- aseprite render tilemaps on texture

backlog
- repo improvements
    - custom file watcher
    - can we make our own language using babel?
    - hot reload?
- general solution to prevent sprites from jittering relative to camera movement
- asset "repositories" (local, remote?, zip)
    - make game files group-downloadable with https://stuk.github.io/jszip/
- allow BasicTexture to be broken into smaller textures if the size limit is surpassed
- apply filter before texture transformation during render? (rotate, scale, etc.)
- module system revamp
    - revamp module system to work with compound types
    - attach arbitrary "update"/"render" objects to worldobjects (e.g. timers, new module system?)
- supertextures ("detective+hat")
- animation/visual layers
- easier window event integration (onbeforeunload, etc.)
- better WorldAsWorldObject (containers?)
- controller revamp
- full nodejs setup
- camera zoom/rotate?
- vs code tasks?
- look into moving from localstorage to indexeddb: https://web.dev/indexeddb/
- normal-map/lighting
- "window" filters
- boundless textures
    - optimize tilemap editing with boundless textures
- print errors on screen?
- loading messages
- hot reloading again (reload just assets?)
- look into babel transformations
- box model P1s
- generic worldobject scale inherited by children + other inherited traits?
- ability to play the intro/splash screen while loading assets
- sfx randomizer + test on nano (load random sfx, lock in good sfx, reshuffle rest, repeat)
- enhanced glitch effect

bugs
- firefox doesn't support fullscreening, and as a result, it can't change game to landscape mode either
- xephia zoom bug on app (pinch and zoom on black area outside canvas)
