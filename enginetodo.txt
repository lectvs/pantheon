TODO NOW
- core improvements
    - load directly from pyxel file (it's just a zip??)
- world improvements
    - world/global "effects" e.g. timescale, camera position, music volume, etc. that only happen while a worldobject is in the world
    - world-specific music and music priority?
- worldobject improvements
    - option to keep children ordered relative to their parent
    - option to consistently keep children/parent close in render order
    - perf improvement opportunity from eliminating getters for delta, physicsGroup, etc.
- issues
    - investigate webgl context lost when rapidly pausing and unpausing

TODO AFTER ABOVE
- update pantheon template
- default/template menus for pause, options, debug, intro, main

TODO AT NEXT GAME'S RELEASE
- remove validations from World.Selecter cache's and start caching!

backlog
- repo improvements
    - custom file watcher
    - can we make our own language using babel?
    - hot reload?
- general solution to prevent sprites from jittering relative to camera movement
- asset "repositories" (local, remote?, zip)
    - make game files group-downloadable with https://stuk.github.io/jszip/
- allow BasicTexture to be broken into smaller textures if the size limit is surpassed
- apply filter before texture transformation during render? (rotate, scale, etc.)
- module system revamp
    - revamp module system to work with compound types
    - attach arbitrary "update"/"render" objects to worldobjects (e.g. timers, new module system?)
- supertextures ("detective+hat")
- animation/visual layers
- easier window event integration (onbeforeunload, etc.)
- better WorldAsWorldObject (containers?)
- better world and object management (freeing)
- controller revamp
- full nodejs setup
- camera zoom/rotate?
- vs code tasks?
- look into moving from localstorage to indexeddb: https://web.dev/indexeddb/
- normal-map/lighting
- "window" filters
- boundless textures
    - optimize tilemap editing with boundless textures
- print errors on screen?
- loading messages
- hot reloading again (reload just assets?)
- look into babel transformations
- box model P1s
- generic worldobject scale inherited by children + other inherited traits?
- ability to play the intro/splash screen while loading assets
- sfx randomizer + test on nano (load random sfx, lock in good sfx, reshuffle rest, repeat)
- enhanced glitch effect

bugs
- firefox doesn't support fullscreening, and as a result, it can't change game to landscape mode either
- xephia zoom bug on app (pinch and zoom on black area outside canvas)
